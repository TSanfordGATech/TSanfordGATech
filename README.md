### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Tori Sanford. I am located in Monroe, GA. 

I am a Senior Business System Analyst for Acuity Brands. I have been with the company for five years. I
have experiance in technical fields including development, QA, and application stupport. My previous
roles have given me experiance in strategic marketing, sales management, and leadership. 

I am currently completing a full stack development course with GA Tech in hopes to expand my coding
knowledge. I will complete this course in May 2021. Once this course work is completed I hope to use
 these skills in my normal day to day job functions or move into the role of a Product Manager.
